DCYE - Gabes Vision
Time Spent: 38 Min

I. Minimum Viable Point: Abillity to localize (define position by size of recognised objects
    A. Greatest area - movement btw. Carousel & Storage Hub. (side strafe-both pol.)
    B. Storage Hub = GROUP contours (measure by density/aspect contours?), Carousel = RECT (from all perspectives)
    C. Polar Hub = RECT + Other (2x? PARABOLA) 
    D. Barriers = RECT of Rect groups (LINE from cam?)
    F. 3 > Obj. Full Field == Global Hub & Carousels (but occlusion)
    G. Obj. for strafe = Hub, Warehouse

 II. Time
    2 Weeks *= 4 Sessions
    Goal = working strafe tracking, simple
        Carousel classifier  []
        Warehouse Classifier []
    GoalAlpha^2 = working full-field tracking, simple
        Global Hub Classifier []
    Goal^3 = mesh tracking, complex-occlusion proofed(?)
    Goal^4 = simple 
 
    GoalBeta = strategies => detect spheres&other obj.

III. GUI Required --> Process
    Goal: Simplify Data Analysis & Classifier Creation
    Estimated Time: 3H
    GUI - up/down move cursor by contour len. (tap?)
    GUI = B to freeze
    print aspect ratio, length, index, x+y coords
